This repository contains the Guide to Scholarly Indexes, a catalog of synthetic documentations about indexes for scholarly publications. It is meant to help publishers selecting the appropriate index or aggregator for their publications, as well as understanding the requirements they will have to meet.

The Guide has been established within the [CRAFT-OA](https://www.craft-oa.eu/) Horizon Europe project, a building project of the [European Diamond Capacity Hub](https://diamas.org/).

The European Diamond Capacity Hub (EDCH) and the CRAFT-OA project aim at supporting the publishers and authors following the [Diamond Open Access model](https://diamas.org/diamond-open-access). The Guide to Scholarly Indexes is one aspect of such support.
